# Contributing

Thank you for making time to (consider) creating an Pull Request for this 
Puppet Module. I Know this puppet module has bugs or missing features and 
that is something you can help me with. When an Pull Request is accepted
your (github) name will be placed in the Contributors of Fame list. 8-)

## Getting started

  * Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
  * Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
  * Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
    * This is usually the master branch.
    * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch.
    * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; 
    `git checkout -b fix/master/my_contribution master`. 
    Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

## Documentation

For changes of a trivial nature to comments and documentation, it is not 
necessary to create a new issue.    

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the puppetlabs organization.
* 
* I'll try to review the Pull Request as soon as I'm able to do.
